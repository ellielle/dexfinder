## DexFinder

My take on the [final project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/final-project) of The Odin
Project's Rails [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails). Instead of building a clone of
Facebook, I've opted to create a site with similar functionality focused around trading, battling and chatting with
[Pok√©mon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon).
